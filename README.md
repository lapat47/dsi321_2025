![High-Level System Design](image/HLD)

##  System Workflow Overview

The system operates in distinct, orchestrated phases designed to ensure efficiency, scalability, and near real-time performance.

---

###  Extract Phase

Data is extracted from two primary external sources:

1. **OpenWeatherAPI**  
   Provides weather-related data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed — critical factors in assessing wildfire risk.

2. **NASA-FIRMS**  
   Supplies near real-time satellite-based fire and thermal anomaly (hotspot) data, which is essential for identifying active wildfire locations.

---

###  Transform Phase

The raw data from both sources undergoes several transformation steps:
- **Cleaning**: Removal of missing, corrupt, or duplicate entries.
- **Normalization**: Standardization of units, formats, and data types.
- **Combining**: Merging weather and fire data by geolocation and timestamp.

>  Intermediate output is stored as **CSV** for manual inspection and testing.  
>  Final data is stored in **Parquet** format, optimized for storage efficiency and analytical performance.

###  Load & Visualization Phase (Orchestrated by Prefect)

####  **Prefect**
Acts as the central **workflow orchestrator**, managing the ETL pipeline to ensure reliability, automation, and timely data refresh.

####  **LakeFS**
Functions as the **data versioning and governance layer**, enabling:
- Reproducibility  
- Isolation of changes  
- Rollback and lineage tracking

####  **Streamlit**
Powers an **interactive dashboard** where users can:
- Explore real-time wildfire activity
- Filter and analyze by location, time, and weather conditions

####  **GeoPandas & Folium**
Integrated within the Streamlit application:
- **GeoPandas** enables spatial joins and geographic computations
- **Folium** renders **interactive maps** and heatmaps to display hotspot density and fire severity

---

This design ensures a **robust**, **scalable**, and **near real-time** wildfire monitoring system that fulfills the objectives of both academic coursework and national disaster response readiness.

####  Data Sources and Structure

The project processes data from two key external APIs:
- **NASA-FIRMS**: Provides global fire and thermal anomaly (hotspot) data.
- **OpenWeatherAPI**: Supplies weather data essential for analyzing fire-prone conditions.

The system organizes the ingested and transformed data into three primary folders:

1. **`df_thai/`**
   - Contains fire hotspot data extracted using `firm.py`.
   - Data is stored in **Hive-partitioned Parquet format** for optimal querying and scalability.

2. **`df_weather/`**
   - Contains weather data extracted using `apiweatherdeploy.py`.
   - Also stored in **Hive-partitioned Parquet format** to align with data lake best practices.

3. **`shape_file/`**
   - Contains geographic boundary shapefiles used for spatial analysis and visualization.
   - Downloadable from [this source](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/d24bdc45-eb4c-4e3d-8b16-44db02667c27/resource/d0c722ff-6939-4423-ac0d-6501830b1759/download/tha_adm_rtsd_itos_20210121_shp.zip)

---

#### Schema Consistency (10 Points)

- The system integrates multiple data sources through automated Prefect flows.
- Schema normalization includes:
  - **Standardized file formats**: CSV → Parquet
  - **Consistent units of measurement** (e.g., temperature in Celsius, wind speed in km/h)
  - **Unified coordinate systems** (latitude/longitude)
- The system leverages **LakeFS** to enforce version-controlled schema evolution and auditing.
- Data formats (Parquet, GeoJSON) are designed for analytical compatibility and consistency.

---
  
#### Record Count ≥ 1,000 (10 Points)

- Data is collected **every 15 minutes**, yielding high-frequency sampling.
- LakeFS manages **large-scale data ingestion**, ensuring historical records are retained.
- Given the data frequency and active periods, the project consistently exceeds **1,000+ records**, especially when analyzing even a few days of data.

---
  
#### 24-Hour Time Coverage (10 Points)

- The system architecture and ETL schedule ensure **continuous data ingestion** across all 24 hours of the day.
- Users can **flexibly query any time window**, including full-day periods, from the Streamlit frontend.
- Scheduled runs through **Prefect ensure no downtime**, maintaining uninterrupted time coverage.

---
  
#### Data Completeness ≥ 90% (10 Points)

- Data quality is central to our **Data Governance Framework**.
- We've defined **Data Quality Rate** as a key performance indicator (KPI) for data ingestion.
- Prefect workflows include:
  - **Validation checks** (e.g., missing fields, malformed rows)
  - **Integrity controls** (e.g., timestamp consistency, null value checks)
- These checks ensure that more than **90% of all records are complete** and usable.
- Completeness is also enforced at the schema level during Parquet write operations.

---
  
#### No 'object' Data Types (5 Points)

- Our project avoids generic `'object'` types by:
  - Using **strongly typed schemas** (via PyArrow + Parquet)
  - Leveraging **GeoPandas** and **Pandas** with explicit dtype enforcement
- Typical data types include:
  - `float` (e.g., brightness, temperature, humidity)
  - `int` (e.g., confidence level)
  - `datetime` (e.g., timestamp)
  - `string` (e.g., location name)
- This ensures compatibility with ML pipelines and analytical operations.

---
  
#### No Duplicate Data (5 Points)

- Deduplication logic is embedded in the **Prefect orchestration** layer:
  - Fire hotspots are uniquely keyed by `latitude`, `longitude`, `timestamp`, and `confidence`.
  - Weather records are uniquely keyed by `timestamp` and location coordinates.
- Before loading to LakeFS, we apply:
  - **Drop-duplicate rules** at ingestion
  - **Hash-based uniqueness checks** for record fingerprinting
- These ensure **zero duplicate entries** in the analytical dataset.

### Part 2: Project Report (10 Points)
This section assesses aspects presented in the report.

#### Data Visualization (5 points)

*   The project objective includes displaying the wildfire situation on an **"interactive map"** (แผนที่เชิงโต้ตอบ).
*   The report details using **Folium for rendering the map on streamlit platform**.
*   It describes displaying results as a **Heatmap** based on the number and brightness of fire points.
*   **Image 7-2** shows below is a diagram explicitly labeling **"Heat Map"** as a feature.
![image 7-2](image/7-2.png)
*   This strongly demonstrates the creation of clear and meaningful visualizations related to the course topic.

#### Using Machine Learning (5 points)

![Randomforest visual](image/RF.png)
##### RF.png


*   The project explicitly states using **"MACHINE LEARNING (RANDOM FOREST)"** to find the relationship between weather conditions and fire hotspots.
*   It specifically details using **Random Forest** to analyze the relationship between the brightness of hotspots and weather variables (Temperature, Humidity, Wind speed).
*   The report includes performing **Feature Importance** analysis on the model.
*   The report presents and **explains the results** through a Correlation Matrix Heatmap/Table, and Scatter Plots showing the relationship between confidence/weather variables and Brightness. Detailed interpretations of these results are provided.
*   Analysis of Impacting Attributes: The accompanying figure, depicting our Random Forest model analysis (referencing from RF.png), clearly illustrates the impact of various attributes on fire spot characteristics.
    - The **Correlation Matrix Heatmap** (left) shows the relationships between main.humidity, main.temp, wind.speed, and brightness. For instance, main.humidity shows a negative correlation with brightness, while main.temp shows a slight positive correlation.
    - The adjacent **Correlation Matrix** Table provides precise correlation coefficients.
    - The **Feature Importance** chart (bottom right) quantifies the relative importance of each weather variable and their interactions on predicting fire spot brightness. Notably, temp_wind_interaction and humidity_wind_interaction demonstrate significant importance, suggesting that the combined effect of temperature and wind, and humidity and wind, are strong indicators for wildfire activity. Individual features like main.humidity, main.temp, and wind.speed also show their respective contributions.
*   This demonstrates the use of an ML technique (Random Forest), provides explanation of the results, and is clearly related to the project topic within the **DSI324 and DSI321** course context. Although the criterion mentioned Linear Regression as an example, Random Forest is a valid ML technique demonstrated and explained in the sources.
